# WebServer
This is a simple hobby webserver I am working on. The project is written entirely in C to try improve my profficiency with with the programming language, and uses CMake to build the project. Currently the "webserver" is not actually a webserver but a half working glorified argument manager. This will be changed some time in the future. (I hope).

```
usage: webserver [-V | --version] [-h | --help] [-s | --serve <http | https | both>] [-d | --root-path <path>] [--http_port <port_no.>] [--https_port <port_no.>] [-v | --verbose]
```
